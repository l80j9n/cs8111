PL 1. Describe bomb calorimetry and the objectives of this experiment (approximately ½ page) (1 mark)
Bomb calorimetry is a process for measuring combustion. The procedure is carried out in a bomb calorimeter, which is tightly controlled chamber where the required amount of sample burns.Oxygen gas fills the bomb and once this is done it is placed in a particular fixed volume ofwater. On ignition, the sample keeps on burning until it gets completely consumed heatgenerated increases the water temperature. The heat released by combustion being used toheat up water, change in water’s temperature can be taken as an index of how much heat wasinvolved in the combustion process.
The main parts of a bomb calorimeter are:The Bomb: It refers to an air-tight container that surrounds both oxygen and the sampledmaterial.A means of firing: A fuse wire normally When one talks about ignitors with fuses, they’remostly referring to those with fuse wire as their anode element.
A jacket containing water: Placed around the bomb during combustion helps to take-up anyheat generated.
A device for measuring temperature: This may consist of accurate thermometer orthermocouple taking differential readings of temperatures
It is required that the heat released during combustion be applied to heating water and bomb calorimeter in line with the first law thermodynamics principle. The total heat capacity of a system should be given or measured using a substance with known heat of combustion such as benzoic acid for instance so as to calculate the sensible heat ‘O’.
PL 2. Briefly define the following terms and explain their relevance to this experiment: (1.5 marks)
Internal energy:
Definition: The total energy contained within a system, including all the kinetic and potential energy of its molecules.
Relevance: In this experiment, the internal energy change (ΔU) during combustion tells us how much energy is released as heat when naphthalene burns in the bomb calorimeter.
State function:
Definition:   A property that depends only on the current state of the system, not on how the system got there.
Relevance:   Internal energy and enthalpy are state functions, meaning the energy change measured during the experiment is the same regardless of the path taken to reach that state.
Heat capacity:
Definition: The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius (or one Kelvin).
Relevance: To calculate the heat released during combustion, we need to know the heat capacity of the calorimeter. This tells us how much the temperature of the calorimeter's water will rise for a given amount of heat.
Enthalpy:
Definition: The total heat content of a system, combining internal energy with the energy needed to displace its surroundings (pressure-volume work).
Relevance: While the experiment measures energy changes at constant volume, enthalpy is useful for understanding heat changes at constant pressure, which is common in many reactions.
Standard state:
Definition: The most stable form. of a substance at 1 atmosphere of pressure and a specified temperature, typically 25°C (298.15 K).
Relevance: Standard state conditions provide a baseline for comparing the heat of combustion and other thermodynamic properties across different substances and reactions.
Hess’s law:
Definition: The total enthalpy change of a reaction is the same, no matter how many steps the reaction takes.
Relevance: Hess’s law helps us calculate the heat of combustion by combining known enthalpies of different steps, allowing us to determine the overall energy change indirectly.

PL 4. Summarise any safety information and precautions for this laboratory. (1 mark)
Always wear personal protective equipment, including lab coats, safety goggles, and gloves. Keep flammable materials away from the combustion area and ensure a fire extinguisher is accessible. Handle the bomb calorimeter carefully, securing all fittings代 写CHEM 252 Laboratory Report Experiment 1: Bomb CalorimetryPython
代做程序编程语言 and valves to prevent leaks and sudden pressure releases. Tighten the bomb's retaining ring securely and have it checked by a supervisor. Ensure the fuse wire is correctly positioned to avoid misfires. During the experiment, allow the calorimeter to reach thermal equilibrium before and after ignition for accurate measurements. If the bomb fails to ignite, seek guidance before attempting re-ignition. After the experiment, release pressure slowly and inspect for incomplete combustion, which requires repetition. Clean the bomb with deionized water, handling parts carefully to avoid damage. Handle benzoic acid and naphthalene with care, and dispose of waste according to guidelines.
